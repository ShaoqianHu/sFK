In example.tar, there is a sample script to run the code (run bash test.sh). 
Note fk.pl in example.tar is different from fk.pl in FK package (version 3.4). 
Also note that the earth flattening transformation should be applied to the input model before running the code (e.g., iasp91 in example.tar).
